Create ENUMs for _every_ gender in different programming languages.

## Summary

Have you ever seen something like this in an application's code?

```csharp
enum Gender
{
    Male,
    Female,
}
```

I can't even look at it! An app has to be more progressive than that! Fortunately you can just [visit the site](https://lehoczky.github.io/gender-enum-generator/), select a language and copy the created ENUM to your codebase.

Works great if you don't know to program, but want to be ~~annoying~~ progressive and contribute to open source projects by extending their gender types.

## Contribution

Pull requests with new languages and gender groups are welcome! Be sure to consult with a gender stuides expert before though.
